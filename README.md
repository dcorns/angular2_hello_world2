# Angular2HelloWorld2

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.16.

This is a replacement repository for angular_hello_world which was created with a previous version of the cli that had a bug in generate. When creating a component, it would not add it to the application module [see issue here](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/2165)</br>
